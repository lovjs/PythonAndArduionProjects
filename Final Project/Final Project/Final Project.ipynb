    "# 1 Abstract / Description\n",
    "\n",
    "For our final project our goal was to use the lidar to detect if Spiecklemire was standing in front of it or not. If he was then we wanted to use the sparkfun OLED display to print out give us an A! if he wasn't then we wanted to print out no Steve ): . We were in fact successful in our endeavors, however they proved to be a little tougher than originally thought for sully reasons.\n",

    "# 2 Schematic\n",
    "\n",
    "We used a cable that came with the lidar in order to plug it into a breadboard that way we could more easily use an arduino to play with it as well as connect the OLED display. We found a github repository for the lidar that had a hookup guide and some starter code for us that was very helpful, I will link it below. I will also provide a sketch with a picture below of our schematic. We did have to use the arduino mega because we needed the memory it had.\n",

    "# 3 Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The code was quite extensive here. Essentially what we have is a giant case statement that changes states at different times. The first few states basically accomplish getting the lidar spinning at a specific speed and checking that its working. Then the next few states start collecting the data and storing it into arrays. Then we print it out and wait to see if the user wants to do it again. During the printing state is when we go through some of the data we collected and see if Spicklemire is standing there. I will provide the code below (beware it is long) and the link to the github repository we used.\n",

    "Theres not much of an analysis to this it either worked or it didn't and luckily for us we managed to get it working. Some of the troubles we ran into was just that the lidar was power hungry and didn't like to share so it had to be plugged directly into the arduino. Then we also had to go through all of the code and change it to what we needed, the only problem we ran into there was us just not using parenthesis. However over all it was a very fun project and was quite a learning experience. "
