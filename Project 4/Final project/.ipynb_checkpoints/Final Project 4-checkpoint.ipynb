    "#  1 Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was a nice change of pace since we got to choose what we were going to do. So what we decided to do was use an arduino to collect the temperature of the room while simultaneously having python read those measurements. As well as display them on a small little oled display that is based on an $i^2c$ connection. We did two runs of data collection each lasting 90 seconds. On average we got 84 degrees Fahrenheit for the first run and 89 degrees Fahrenheit for the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2 Description\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project our main goal was to measure something using some kind of sensor hooked up to an arduino. Then at the same time feed the data directly into python via the serial connection and also incorporate some kind of $i^2c$ connection in the process. We used an arduino paired with a temperature sensor and an oled display to achieve this goal. We got most of the wiring information off of Sparkfun's website.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3 Schematic\n",
    "\n",
    "For this week's project we got to build our own circuit 100% from scratch with no recipe. For the temperature sensor we needed a $2k\\Omega$ resistor, an arduino and a breadboard. We choose the resistor value based on Sparkfun's recommendation for that sensor. Then we followed the schematic they provided as well. We also snagged their information on our level converter and the oled display. As always I have a beautiful schematic for you below.\n",

    "# 4 Code\n",
    "\n",
    "For this week we had quite a bit of coding on our plates. For the temperature sensor we took the example code off of sparkfun's website and then tweaked it to work at the press of a button... see what I did there. (;  We also got the oled display example code off their website however we had to adjust it quite a bit to fit our needs. For the python we took some code from your example code and adjusted it for our needs. As always I will provide pictures for a more aesthetically pleasing viewing process as well as the actual code below.\n",

    "# 6 Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We assumed the the room temperature was roughly 70 - 75 degrees Fahrenheit. We also assumed that Allison had an average skin temperature of around 85-95 degrees Fahrenheit at room temperature. For the analysis I took the averages of the two runs and compared them to what I expected and saw what I considered to be reasonable data for the second test but not the first. However I had quite a few observations that puzzled me. First I found it quite odd how we would get very large temperature spikes randomly. Second I'm not at all convinced that the temperature was anywhere near 84 degrees Fahrenheit in the room we were in. Third while the first data set didn't seem accurate; at first look the second does, with it only being two degrees off of what we expected which isn't abnormal at all. However when you take a closer look and calculate the standard deviation you see really I have no business telling you anything about this data set with a standard deviation of 11. So to mitigate some of these problems I've found I assumed that the large spikes are not good readings and threw those out. After I did this I found that the standard deviation was miles better! However the mean for the first run still is not close to what I expected it to be but the mean from the second run is still not at all to far away from a realistic number. This also doesn't make since to me because if you go with the conclusion that the temperature sensor gives readings hotter than normal then that would explain the first run but not the second because the second run is on the colder side of our range. This left me confused for a second. Even after that I don't think its fair to say that the temperature sensor is completely wrong because the readings while not super close aren't completely outlandish. So the conclusion I have drawn is that the temperature sensor is much more accurate when it is making direct contact with what it is trying to measure. This makes sense because while the temperature senor could make \"direct contact\" with the air around it, it also had a lot of other objects near it that could have easily effected it; where as with the finger test the sensor had the finger surrounding it which meant that it had very little chance of anything interfering with it. That is why I feel that the sensor is actually accurate within a degree roughly."
