# PythonAndArduionProjects
Python reports mixed with arduino projects

This is a mixture of python projects that I did for my physics class as well as arduino projects. The jupter notebooks have 
anything and everything you would want to know about them. The coolest project by far was the final project in which
we got to choose what to do. I choose to create a lidar program using the arduino and a cheap lidar, that detected if my proffesor
was standing near the lidar and if he was it printed out for him to give me an A!
